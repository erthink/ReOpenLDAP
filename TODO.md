Unfortunately, on 2022-04-15 the Github administration, without any
warning nor explanation, deleted _ReOpenLDAP_ along with a lot of other
projects, simultaneously blocking access for many developers. Therefore
on 2022-04-21 we have migrated to a reliable trusted infrastructure.
The origin for now is at[GitFlic](https://gitflic.ru/project/erthink/reopenldap)
with backup at [ABF by ROSA Лаб](https://abf.rosalinux.ru/erthink/ReOpenLDAP).
For the same reason ~~Github~~ is blacklisted forever.

So currently most of the links are broken due to noted malicious ~~Github~~ sabotage.

- [ ] reimplement: ITS#8054 add queue time to log (a0cc1d9655da112a4d19cddf821460a4dedeed1c)
- [ ] test: test066-autoca
- [ ] fix: todo4recovery://erased_by_github/erthink/ReOpenLDAP/issues/121 and todo4recovery://erased_by_github/erthink/ReOpenLDAP/issues/102 (seems the same)
- [ ] test: use gdb as supervisor
