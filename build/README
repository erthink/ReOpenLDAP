The ReOpenLDAP build environment relies on non-standard versions of
configuration tools:
	Autoconf 2.71
	Automake 1.16
	Libtool 2.4

The autoconf/automake releases used are available at:
	ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/tools/

The libtool release used is available from:
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/

but with ltmain.sh replaced with versions found in this directory.
