Style Guide
-----------

Unfortunately, historically ReOpenLDAP has inherited a 'rebus'
codestyle from the OpenLDAP projects, as well as a huge
technical debt.

Therefore, the requirements are minimal:

1) for new modules it is recommended to use the
   [LLVM Code Style](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html).

2) for patches just strive to minimize volume of changes without
   losing clarity of the code.

3) Spread at least a little bit of the quality and clarity by an each commit.
