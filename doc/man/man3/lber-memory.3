.BI "void *ber_memcalloc(ber_len_t " nelems ", ber_len_t " bytes ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These routines are used to allocate/deallocate memory used/returned
by the Lightweight BER library as required by
.BR lber-encode (3)
and
.BR lber-decode (3).
.BR ber_memalloc (),
.BR ber_memcalloc (),
.BR ber_memrealloc (),
and
.BR ber_memfree ()
are used exactly like the standard
.BR malloc (3),
.BR calloc (3),
.BR realloc (3),
and
.BR free (3)
routines, respectively.  The
.BR ber_memvfree ()
routine is used to free a dynamically allocated array of pointers to
arbitrary dynamically allocated objects.
