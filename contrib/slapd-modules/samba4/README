# $ReOpenLDAP$

This directory contains slapd overlays specific to samba4 LDAP backend:

	- pguid (not used)
	- rdnval (under evaluation)
	- vernum (under evaluation)


  - PGUID

This overlay maintains the operational attribute "parentUUID".  It contains
the entryUUID of the parent entry.  This overlay is not being considered
right now.


  - RDNVAL

This overlay maintains the operational attribute "rdnValue".  It contains
the value of the entry's RDN.  This attribute is defined by the overlay
itself as

	( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.1.58
		NAME 'rdnValue'
		DESC 'the value of the naming attributes'
		SYNTAX '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15'
		EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
		USAGE dSAOperation
		NO-USER-MODIFICATION )

under ReOpenLDAP's development OID arc.  This OID is temporary.

To use the overlay, add:

	moduleload contrib-rdnval.la
	...

	database <whatever>
	...
	overlay rdnval

to your slapd configuration file.  An instance is required for each database
that needs to maintain this attribute.


  - VERNUM

This overlay increments a counter any time an attribute is modified.
It is intended to increment the counter 'msDS-KeyVersionNumber' when
the attribute 'unicodePwd' is modified.


These overlays are only set up to be built as a dynamically loaded modules.
On most platforms, in order for the modules to be usable, all of the
library dependencies must also be available as shared libraries.

If you need to build the overlays statically, you will have to move them
into the slapd/overlays directory and edit the Makefile and overlays.c
to reference them.
