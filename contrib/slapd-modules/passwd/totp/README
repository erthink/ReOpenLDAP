TOTP ReOpenLDAP support
----------------------

contrib-pw-totp.c provides support for RFC 6238 TOTP Time-based One
Time Passwords in ReOpenLDAP using SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
For instance, one could have the LDAP attribute:

userPassword: {TOTP1}GEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQGEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQ

which encodes the key '12345678901234567890'.


Building
--------

1) configure --enable-modules --enable-contrib
Customize the LDAP_SRC variable in Makefile to point to the ReOpenLDAP
source root.

2) Run 'make' to produce contrib-pw-totp.la

3) Run 'make install'

4) Edit your slapd.conf (eg. /etc/ldap/slapd.conf), and add:

moduleload contrib-pw-totp.la

5) This module replaces the function of the slapo-lastbind overlay. You
cannot use that overlay on the same database as this one.

6) Restart slapd.


Configuring
-----------

The {TOTP1}, {TOTP256}, and {TOTP512} password schemes should now be recognised.

You can also tell ReOpenLDAP to use one of these new schemes when processing LDAP
Password Modify Extended Operations, thanks to the password-hash option in
slapd.conf. For example:

password-hash	{TOTP1}

On the databases where your users reside you must configure both the
lastbind overlay and the totp overlay:

database mdb
...

overlay totp



Testing
-------

The TOTP1 algorithm is compatible with Google Authenticator.
