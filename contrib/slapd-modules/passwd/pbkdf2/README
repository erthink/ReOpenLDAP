PBKDF2 for ReOpenLDAP
=======================

pw-pbkdf2.c provides PBKDF2 key derivation functions in ReOpenLDAP.

Schemes:

 * {PBKDF2} -  alias to {PBKDF2-SHA1}
 * {PBKDF2-SHA1}
 * {PBKDF2-SHA256}
 * {PBKDF2-SHA512}

# Requirements

  * OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later

# Installations

First, You need to configure and build ReOpenLDAP.

    $ configue --enable-modules --enable-contrib ...
    $ make
    $ make install

# Configration

In slapd.conf:

    moduleload contrib-pw-pbkdf2.so

You can also tell ReOpenLDAP to use the schemes when processing LDAP
Password Modify Extended Operations, thanks to the password-hash
option in slapd.conf. For example:

    password-hash {PBKDF2}
or
    password-hash {PBKDF2-SHA256}
or
    password-hash {PBKDF2-SHA512}

# Testing

You can get hash to use slappasswd.

    $ slappasswd -o module-load=contrib-pw-pbkdf2.so -h {PBKDF2} -s secret
    {PBKDF2}60000$Y6ZHtTTbeUgpIbIW0QDmDA$j/aU7jFKUSbH4UobNQDm9OEIwuw

A quick way to test whether it's working is to customize the rootdn and
rootpw in slapd.conf, eg:

    rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
    rootpw {PBKDF2}60000$Y6ZHtTTbeUgpIbIW0QDmDA$j/aU7jFKUSbH4UobNQDm9OEIwuw

Then to test, run something like:

    $ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=example,dc=com" -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret

# Debugging
You can specify -DSLAPD_PBKDF2_DEBUG flag for debugging.

# Message Format

    {PBKDF2}<Iteration>$<Adapted Base64 Salt>$<Adapted Base64 DK>
