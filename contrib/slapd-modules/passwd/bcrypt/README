bcrypt ReOpenLDAP support
----------------------
bcrypt.c provides support for bcrypt password hashes in ReOpenLDAP.

About bcrypt
------------
Bcrypt is a modern password hashing method, based on the Blowfish block cipher.
It is designed by Niels Provos and David Mazieres, and is used in OpenBSD.

From Wikipedia:
Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is
an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it
slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with
increasing computation power. (See 'Choosing a work factor' below.)

A bcrypt hash in ReOpenLDAP looks like this:

{BCRYPT}$2b$08$eSLWg21V/YvYvHYoWXFaKutal4LcolDv6.K/zgGmPJhDdytkb4yOe

- {BCRYPT} is the name of the scheme
- $2b$ means it will always use the 'safe', modern version of the algorithm, as
  discussed in http://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2011/07/17/1
  The original safe version had the $2y$ prefix. OpenBSD 5.5+ has a different
  prefix for the same thing, which is $2b$ so we prefer that.
  See also http://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2014/08/31/1
- 08 is the work factor (this is the default)
- Next is 16 bytes of random salt
- The rest is the actual hash

The work factor defines the number of rounds, and is a base 2 logarithm. So going
from work factor 8 to 9 means the hash takes twice as much time to generate
(and crack).

Building
--------
1) Build and install ReOpenLDAP itself from the root of the distribution or
from a git checkout

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-contrib [other options you want]
$ make depend
$ make
$ sudo make install

2) Optional: Customize your setup

Prefix
The default prefix is /usr/local which means the module will be installed in
/usr/local/lib/reopenldap. If you want to change that, edit the 'prefix'
variable in the Makefile. It is probably best to set this to whatever you set
the --prefix to in step 1.

Work factor
The default work factor used by OpenBSD for regular user passwords is 8. It is
also the default used by this module. The work factor can be set in slapd.conf
but you can also change the default work factor in the code by editing
bcrypt.c: just set BCRYPT_DEFAULT_WORKFACTOR to the value you want.

The work factor must be between 4 (very fast, not very safe) and 31 (insane,
completely unusable; this will basically lock up the server).

No matter what the work factor is set to in the code or in the configuration
file, you will always be able to validate existing passwords that were hashed
with different work factors.

3) Edit your slapd.conf, and add:

moduleload    contrib-pw-bcrypt.so WORKFACTOR
(or wherever you ended up putting your module)

The WORKFACTOR argument can be omitted, in which case slapd will use the default
of 8 or whatever you set it to in step 3.

If you want all your new hashes to use bcrypt (in Password Modify Extended
Operations), set this in your slapd.conf:

password-hash   {BCRYPT}

However, make sure that all LDAP servers in your environment have the module
loaded before you do this, otherwise your users will not be able to authenticate.

6) Restart slapd.

Testing
-------
Use slappasswd to generate some hashes.

$ slappasswd -h '{BCRYPT}' -o module-load="<path-to-the-module>/contrib-pw-bcrypt.so" -s randompassword

(Yes, the keyword here is 'module-load' with a - (dash). In slapd.conf the
keyword is 'moduleload' without the dash.)

Unfortunately, slappasswd does not allow providing any arguments to the module,
so all hashes created with slappasswd will have the default work factor, which
is 8 (or whatever you set it to in bcrypt.c if you edited that).

Debugging
---------
To see what's going on, recompile with SLAPD_BCRYPT_DEBUG (use the commented-out
DEFS in the Makefile), and then run slapd from the console:

/usr/local/libexec/slapd -d

WARNING: With debugging enabled, all passwords will be logged in plaintext!
