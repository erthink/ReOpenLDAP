This directory contains a slapd module proxyOld that provides support
for the obsolete draft-weltman-ldapb3-proxy-05 revision of the LDAP
Proxy Authorization control. It is merely intended to provide compatibility
in environments where other servers only recognize this old control.
New installations should not use this code.

To use the module, add:

	moduleload contrib-proxyOld.so
	...

to your slapd configuration file. Since this is an obsolete feature,
the control is registered with the SLAP_CTRL_HIDE flag so that it will
not be advertised in the rootDSE's supportedControls attribute.

This code only works as a dynamically loaded module.
